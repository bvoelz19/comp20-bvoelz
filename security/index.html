        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The product I am analyzing in this assignment is Avita Sharma's 'notuber' application,
           which allows clients to send and receive data about requesting or offering
           ride-sharing services. My job is to scan the application for security vulnerabilities
           and privacy problems to allow the client to better strengthen their app so that
           they can be protected from potential malicious threats.</p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>In order to identify security and privacy threats, I first looked over the 'notuber'
           source code to see if I could observe any overt issues related to poor programming
           practices. Then, I began running tests using curl to see which HTTP routes had
           vulnerabilities that could be exploited. After recording my results from these tests,
           I was able to nail down three major security issues in the 'notuber' application that
           I will now describe.</p>

        <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
        <p>In examining the 'notuber' application, I was able to find three major privacy/security
           vulnerabilities that can and should be remedied. First, I found a privacy issue in the
           index page that consisted of the client's username hard-coded into the HTML. Second, I
           discovered that the developer is not sanitizing client data before processing requests. 
           Lastly, I found that as a result of not sanitizing data, the application is vulnerable to 
           cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</p>

        <h2>Issues Found</h2>
        <div class="subheader">Public Information</div>
        <p>After looking through the index.html page of the 'notuber' application, I quickly viewed
           an immediate security and privacy concern. The application developer chose to hard-code
           her own username into the public html document.</p>
        <img src="username.png"/>
        <p>This is a problem because with the increasingly
           accessible nature of web browsers, anyone can easily view the source code for the index page
           and grab the username as well as the API key (which was commented out) to perform harmful
           actions (i.e. posing as the user to send hundreds of requests to rack up credit card bill,
           leave negative reviews, etc.). I would rank this as a relatively medium level threat, as it
           allows anyone to send requests to the server to gather data about the user's location and private
           information. To remedy this issue, I would recommend that instead the user pass her username
           dynamically instead of hard-coding it into the HTML.</p>
        </br>
        <div class="subheader">Client Data Sanitization</div>
        <p>When I began looking at the actual JavaScript in the index.js file for the 'notuber' application,
           I suspected that there might be a potential vulnerability regarding the trusting of client data.
           In fact, it turned out that when I ran the following command:</p>
        <img src="clientdata.png"/>
        <p>I was able to successfully insert JavaScript into the username field of a MongoDB document entry. 
           As a result, when you open up the home page the JavaScript runs and prints 'Hello world!' to the console.
           This vulnerability came a result of the developer's failure to sanitize the data in the HTTP
           request body, and could have been avoided by simply including the following line when parsing the
           request body:</p>
        <img src="sanitizedata.png"/>
        </br>
        <p>As a result of the developer's failure to sanitize client data, which was described above, I was able to perform 
           a cross-site scripting attack by injecting JavaScript into the username field. I ran the following command to insert
           a script that immediately changes the browser window's location to the Google homepage:</p>
        <img src="xss.png"/>
        <p>The issue of cross-site scripting is extremely relevant in the world of web security today, as it remains to
           be one of the prominent sources of cyber attacks. The XSS attack that I performed could have been much more
           dangerous, but I simply wanted to demonstrate that literally any JavaScript could be inserted and run when
           XSS is not taken into consideration when designing a web app. While this XSS attack just redirects the page
           to a harmless URL, a cyber attacker could insert scripts that access the MongoDB database and store passenger
           locations, passwords, etc. I would rank this as a relatively high-level threat, as there are essentially infinite
           possibilities of what an attack could do when exploiting this vulnerability; they could inject literally any
           JavaScript they wanted.</p>
        <div class="subheader">Inserting Additional Database Fields</div>
        <p>After playing with the 'notuber' application's vulnerability to cross-site scripting, I realized that I could
           insert additional data fields through the '/submit' POST route, and that these fields would be stored on the
           MongoDB database while still receiving the same server response. To demonstrate this phenomenon, I ran the following command to inject a large text file as a 'Shakespeare' data member:</p>
        <img src="shakespeare.png"/>
        <p>I would rank this as a medium level threat, as the only concern is the database cost of storing more data than is 
           necessary, thus slowing down the GET routes. However, it is evident that one could easily exploit this vulnerability to quickly drive up server costs. Even though these additional fields will not ever be returned to the
           client through the GET route, it is still an issue that could easily be removed by only adding an object to the
           MongoDB database that has the desired fields.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In sum, it is clear that in its current state, the 'notuber' application has several major security
           vulnerabilities that must be fixed before the product is shipped out to consumers. While it is easy enough
           to sanitize data to prevent basic curl-level cross-site scripting attacks, it is reasonable to expect that
           experienced hackers would be able to find more sneaky ways to access private info (i.e. passenger locations),
           store it in their own database, and delete the 'notuber' database entry that contains the script. Therefore,
           it may be worthwhile to consider running a script on the server every so often that scans the database entries
           for any suspicious content, and if so removes them and investigates the issue. These additional measures
           may demand more server resources, but the payoff of ensuring the security of data and application content
           should be invaluable to developers. Much like a computer needs anti-virus software, developers need to include
           security software (whether they write or purchase it) to prevent any possibility of falling victim to cyber 
           attacks that exploit security issues like those discussed above.</p>
