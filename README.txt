Lab 9: Learning Portfolio

- The purpose of this Git repository is to store and organize my assignments
  in COMP-0020: Web Programming for Spring 2017.

- My favorite assignment was the responsive lab, which opened my eyes up to
  the challenges surrounding the ever-expanding world of technology and its
  implications on web development.

- I think that I have grown an immense amount since day 1 of this course. Not
  only have I learned about how the web works, basic web programming skills, and
  new debugging strategies, I've also improved my ability to self-teach.

- The most important thing I learned in this course was how the web works.
  Now that I know how the web works, writing server-side JavaScript is easy
  because if I ever get confused I can refer to the diagram in my head to
  reorient myself. Also, now I know what happens when you hit 'enter' on a
  browser search bar, which gives me a greater understanding of how the internet
  of things works as well.

- Going forward, I plan to delve deeper into the topic of mobile development and
  its role in VR/AR technology.
