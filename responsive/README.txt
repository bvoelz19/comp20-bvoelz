Assignment 2: Responsive
	The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate my understanding
	of responsive design and its applications in HTML and CSS. By
	performing media queries on the screen size of the device viewing
	the index page, I was able to make sprites out of the "ralphy.gif"
	image file and display the appropriate panel of the gif.

Correctly Implemented:
	To my knowledge, all modules of this assignment have been implemented
	according to the assignment's specifications.

Collaboration:
	I read the articles linked on the assignment specification page to
	gain an understanding of how media queries work. I also consulted
	StackOverflow to get past a bug I was having -- I didn't realize that
	content in a div element will not display until the width and
	height are defined.

Hours Spent:
	~5 hours
